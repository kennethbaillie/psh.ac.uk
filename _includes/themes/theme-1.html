                Whenever an infection spreads, some of us are very susceptible, and others don't get sick at all. This variation can enable us to find the specific molecular changes in the genome that drive severe disease. These genetic changes sometimes act a bit like the effect of a drug, which means we can ask the most important question in the PSH: what would be the effect of treating people with this drug?
