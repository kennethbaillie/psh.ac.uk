<p>The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is said to have originated in the 16th century. Lorem
    Ipsum is composed in a pseudo-Latin language which more or less corresponds to 'proper' Latin. It contains a
    series of real Latin words. This ancient dummy text is also incomprehensible, but it imitates the rhythm of most
    European languages in Latin script. The advantage of its Latin origin and the relative meaninglessness of Lorum
    Ipsum is that the text does not attract attention to itself or distract the viewer's attention from the layout.
